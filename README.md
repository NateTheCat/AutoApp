# AutoApp
Work-in-progress browser extension for filling out annoying job applications with shitty resume parsing.

I spend like 30 minutes manually adding every single job I've worked along with dates and descriptions just to get rejected before anyone even bothers downloading my resume or even viewing the profile created by the system so this will turn in into 30 seconds (hopefully).
